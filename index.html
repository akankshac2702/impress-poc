        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheet. Script adds all styles it needs for
        presentation to work.
        
        This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Impress.js
        classes are used to style presentation steps, and apply fallback styles.

<!--
    Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
    the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.

    First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
    will also get fallback styles.
    
    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
    be removed.
    
    The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
    it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.  
-->
<body class="impress-not-supported">

<!--
    This fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body.
-->
<div class="fallback-message">
    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>
</div>

<!-- 
    The core element used by impress.js, is the element with id='impress'.

    The entire presentation lives inside the <div> container with 'id='impress''.
    The container may not necessarily be a <div> but the 'id='impress'' is important; the script finds the 
    presentation by this id only.   
    
    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).
    I have applied it to 900 so as to use the effect of this CSS property and not have much effect on the 
    transition duration of slides.
    
    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
-->
<div id="impress" data-transition-duration="900" data-perspective="1000">

    <!--  
        We are now in the play area...
        Each <div> here corressponds to a slide. Nested divs not counted. 
        
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
        
        It will not be rotated or scaled.   
    -->
    <div id="position_xy" class="step slide" data-x="-1000" data-y="-1500">
        <q>My position is <b>x=-1000</b> and <b>y=-1500</b>. I am a slide. </q>
    </div>

    <!--  
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        
        So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.
        
        The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.
        
        You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.
        
        Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
        Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.   
    -->
    <div class="step slide" data-x="0" data-y="-1500">
        <q>I am Slide 2. Notice that my id is <strong>not defined</strong> so I have <strong>step-2</strong> appended to my URL</q>
    </div>

    <!-- 
        This is an example of step element being scaled.
        
        Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
        element will be 4 times larger than the others.
        From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
        down (4 times) to make it back to it's correct size.     
    -->
    <div id="scaling" class="step" data-x="0" data-y="0" data-scale="4">
        <span class="try">I am not a slide. I'm</span>
        <h1>scaled</h1>
    </div>

    <!--
        This element introduces rotation.
        
        Notation shouldn't be a surprise. We use `data-rotate="90"` attribute, meaning that this
        element should be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.
    -->
    <div id="rotation" class="step" data-x="850" data-y="3000" data-rotate="90" data-scale="5">
        <p>I'm <strong>rotated</strong><br/>
        by<strong> 90</strong><sup>o</sup> right, on x-axis</p>
    </div>

    <div id="rotation_y" class="step" data-x="3000" data-y="2800" data-rotate="-90" data-scale="6">
       <p>I'm <strong>rotated</strong><br/>
        by<strong> 90</strong><sup>o</sup> left, on x-axis</p>
    </div>

    <!--
        And now it gets really exiting! We move into third dimension!
        
        Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
        `data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
        positioned far away from us (by 3000px).
    -->
    <div id="data_z" class="step" data-x="1700" data-y="2825" data-z="-3000" data-rotate="0" data-scale="2">
        <p>dive <b>into</b> it</p>
    </div>

    <div id="data_zp" class="step" data-x="2500" data-y="2825" data-z="3000" data-rotate="0" data-scale="2">
        <p>and <b>rise</b> up</p>
    </div>

    <!--
        This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
        reached.
        
        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
        It means that they haven't been visited yet.
        
        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.
        
        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
        class is added.
        
        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
        Only one current step has the `present` class.
    -->

    <!--        
        You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
        So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
        10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.
        
        You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
        as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).

    <!--
        So to make a summary of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:
        
        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` -- they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` -- they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` -- defines the scale of step element; default value is 1
        
        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

        Overview slide shows the entire canvas in one go.

<!--   
    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.
    
    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.
    
    When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
    gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.
-->
<div class="hint">
    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate</p>
</div>
<script>
if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) { 
    document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>";
}
</script>

<!--
    Include impress.js in the page to make the presentation work.

   `impress().init()` function call initializes the impress.js presentation.

    Do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
-->
<script src="js/impress-poc.js"></script>
<script>impress().init();</script>

<!--
    The `impress()` function also gives access to the API that controls the presentation.
    
    Store the result of the call:
    
        var api = impress();
    
    and this gets three functions to call:
    
        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
        `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.
    
    Using `impress()` again gets the API, so `impress().next()` is also valid.
    This wont initialize the presentation again.
